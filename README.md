# pt-showcase

This repo is for a small static site meant to showcase some renders for a product concept I made in Blender. Go look at them here: https://pixelbase.zyplos.dev


This project used [Bun](https://bun.sh)'s React starter.


To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To start a development server:

```bash
