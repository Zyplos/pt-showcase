        Its nature is to store up electricity. Forests where nests of Pikachu
        live are dangerous, since the trees are so often struck by
        lightning.Volbeat’s tail glows like a lightbulb. With other Volbeat, it
        uses its tail to draw geometric shapes in the night sky. This Pokémon
        loves the sweet aroma given off by Illumise.Whismur is very timid. If it
        starts to cry loudly, it becomes startled by its own crying and cries
        even harder. When it finally stops crying, the Pokémon goes to sleep,
        all tired out.

        Sunkern tries to move as little as it possibly can. It does so because
        it tries to conserve all the nutrients it has stored in its body for its
        evolution. It will not eat a thing, subsisting only on morning dew.The
        pink of Corsola that live in Alola is deep and vibrant, thanks to seas
        filled with nutrition.Meditite heightens its inner energy through
        meditation. It survives on just one berry a day. Minimal eating is
        another aspect of this Pokémon’s training.

        Hitmonlee’s legs freely contract and stretch. Using these springlike
        legs, it bowls over foes with devastating kicks. After battle, it rubs
        down its legs and loosens the muscles to overcome fatigue.Its pantomime
        skills are wonderful. You may become enraptured while watching it, but
        next thing you know, Mr. Mime has made a real wall.If areas of
        Cloyster’s very hard shell get damaged, those areas swell, gradually
        growing into large sharp spikes.
